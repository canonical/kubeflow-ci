This is a batch update to our repos completed using [git-xargs](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/git-xargs).  Execution was completed using commands listed in `run_git-xargs.sh`.

`git-xargs` executes the script you provide to modify one or more repos.  It:
* pulls each repo
* executes the provided script in the root dir of each repo
* creates PRs for each change
* tries to handle rate limiting issues from GitHub

The `main.py` script does the actual work.  It can be executed in the base dir of any of our repos, and has a few reusable snippets of code for copying files and patching yaml.  

### NOTE:

Some of our multi-charm repos .gitignore the charm lib folders, so we needed to force adding them to the repos.
