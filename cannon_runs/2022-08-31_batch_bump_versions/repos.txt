# Generated using `gh search repos --topic charmed-kubeflow | awk '{print $1}' > repos.txt`
# Note that this list was all charms as of this run, but if running this in future you should build
# your own list as new repositories may have been added.  
# This execution used the entire list, but if you know you only need to search a subset of the
# repos you could filter this list first.
