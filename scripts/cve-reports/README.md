## Sending reports to Jira

To send reports to Jira:

```
send-scan.py --report-path <path-to-report(s)> --jira-url <URL-to-Jira>
```

- `--report-path` - Specifies location of report(s). If it is single file, it will be parsed on its own. If it is a directory all files in the directory will be parsed one by one. Only JSON and SARIF formats are supported.
- `--jira-url` - Specifies URL of Jira automation to which reports should be sent.
- `--add-github-meta` -  If set, GitHub metadata is added to the sent request. This metadata will be generated automatically from the runner's environment variables: GITHUB_SERVER_URL, GITHUB_RUN_ID, GITHUB_SHA, GITHUB_REPOSITORY. The default behaviour is to not send the metadata.
- `--verbose` - If set, the body and return code of request will be printed. Defaults to non-verbose.

## Testing

To test use reports under `./tests` directory. Those reports can be supplied to `send-scan.py` script to make sure they can be processed.
